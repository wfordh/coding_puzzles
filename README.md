# Coding Puzzles

This repository will be a collection of solutions (or maybe just attempts) to different coding exercises I encounter. The exercises will come from all sorts of sources, including a class from my master's program at USF, interviews, data science prep resources, and anywhere else on the web that I see them. I will keep this page up to date with a list of completed exercises and a quick description of the problem.
